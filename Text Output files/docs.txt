* **Cancellations:** Orders or subscriptions may be canceled within a defined period (e.g., 14 days) depending on the product/service.
* **Service Availability:** Some services may vary by region. Agents should verify availability before confirming with customers.

## 5. Technical Support

* **Escalations:** Complex issues beyond Tier 1 support are escalated to technical specialists. Customers will be updated regularly until resolution.
* **Downtime & Maintenance:** Scheduled maintenance windows are communicated in advance. Unexpected outages are updated on the service status page.

## 6. Complaints & Feedback

* **Complaint Handling:** Customers should be acknowledged promptly. Agents must log complaints and provide an estimated resolution time.

## 7. Privacy & Security

## 8. Resolution & Follow-Up

* **First Contact Resolution:** Whenever possible, issues should be resolved during the initial interaction.

This FAQ & Policies document serves as a **general framework** for customer support conversations across industries. It is flexible enough to be adapted for specific company policies, products, or services.
call_analysis_pipeline.py

Modular pipeline (hardcoded mode) that runs transcription, diarization, sentiment/tonality/intent,
summarization and RAG steps, and then **exports CSV files** required by the evaluation script:

 - pipeline_transcripts.csv  (call_id,transcript)
 - segments_pred.csv         (segment_id,call_id,start,end,speaker,text,sentiment_pred,intent_pred,tonality_pred)
 - summary_preds.csv         (call_id,predicted_summary)
 - analysis_output.csv       (full dataframe with model outputs)

Edit the HARD-CODED CONFIG at the bottom to point at your audio file and docs file.
Dependencies (install locally):
    pip install pandas numpy scipy transformers torch torchaudio pydub whisperx langchain_cohere jiwer rouge-score scikit-learn
(you may not need all of the above for evaluation; install only what you require)

Note: This script preserves your original logic and model choices. It only adds deterministic,
safe exports so the evaluation script you shared can run without extra manual steps.
