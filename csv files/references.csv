c1,"Hi everyone. My name is Durgesh Shukla and I am the trainer of Office Administration at ICICI Foundation. In this video we demonstrate how to attend official calls. A customer calls to complain that their cheque book has not arrived even after several days. The agent apologizes, requests identity details (name and date of birth), verifies that the cheque book was dispatched and provides a transaction number for tracking. The agent reassures the customer that delivery should happen by tomorrow, offers escalation if delivery fails, and ends the call politely with a thank you."
